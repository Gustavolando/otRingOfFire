## Ring of Fire

This is an outstanding CSS and SVG animation effect!  And one of the first SVG animation I have coded.  Additionally I practiced with the -webkit-box-reflect and the blur and hue-rotate filter effects.

This was taken from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avo71iW9mI4)

Amazing HTML(SVG) and CSS ONLY!!

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otRingOfFire/) !
